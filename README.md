# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the effect of paying for reviews on a retail website, like Amazon. Companies hosted on the Amazon pay it a small fee and give the paid reviewers the product. The paid reviewers are members of the Amazon Vine program. Therefore, I compared the vine and non-vine Amazon reviews.

## Results

* **Vine and non-Vine reviews**

There were 170 reviews from the vine program and 37840 non-Vine reviews.

* **5 stars Vine reviews**

65 of the Vine reviews were 5 stars and 20612 of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

*  **Percentage of 5 star Vine reviews**

38.24 percent of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 54.47 percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
