# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the effect of paying for reviews on a retail website, like Amazon. Companies hosted on Amazon pay it a small fee and give paid reviewers the product. The paid reviewers are members of the Amazon Vine program. However, paying the Vine members may give them a positive bias towards the product. To determine the validity of reviews from the Vine members I compared the positivity bias of Vine and non-Vine Amazon reviews.

## Results

* **Vine and non-Vine reviews**

There were 170 reviews from the vine program and 37,840 non-Vine reviews. The separated non-Vine and Vine data tables are displayed below.

* **5 stars Vine reviews**

65 of the Vine reviews were 5 stars and 20,612 of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

*  **Percentage of 5 star Vine reviews**

38.24 percent of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 54.47 percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary

There was a larger percent of non-Vine 5 star reviews compared to Vine 5 star reviews. 38.2% of the Vine reviews were 5 stars, while 54.4% of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. Therefore, there is no positivity bias for 5 star reviews in the Vine program. However, it would be helpful to also compare the 4 star reviews from Vine and non_Vine reviewers. Both 4 and 5 stars are considered positive, while 1 or 2 star reviews are negative. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis would also contain the percent of 4 star Vine and non_Vine reviews.
